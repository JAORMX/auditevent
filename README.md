# `auditevent`

A small, opinionated library to help you create audit events.

## Context

While audit logging may seem like a very simple thing to add to an application, doing it right is
full of caveats. This library aims to provide a simple, general, intuitive and standardize
representation for an audit event. This will help us having uniform logs and and meet
regulatory compliance requirements.
